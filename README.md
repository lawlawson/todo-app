A CRUD application I have worked on as part of my journey whilst learning React.js.

## Instructions

### Adding

To add an item to the list, click on the text box, enter some text and click the + button.

### Completing

To mark and item as completed and put a line through it, simply click on the tick.

### Removing

To remove an item, click on the trash can symbol.

### Filtering

You can filter by all, completed or uncompleted. Simply select the drop-down arrow and select the option which will display the items based on your selection.
